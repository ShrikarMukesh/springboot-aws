Amazon Simple Notification Service:
 Pub/sub messaging for microservices and serverless applications.
Benefits and features:-
1)Reliably deliver messages with durability
   Amazon SNS uses cross availability zone message storage to provide high message durability. 
   Amazon SNS reliably delivers messages to valid AWS endpoints, such as 
   Amazon SQS queues and AWS Lambda functions.
2)Automatically scale your workload
  Amazon SNS leverages the proven AWS cloud to dynamically scale with your application. 
  Amazon SNS is a fully managed service, taking care of the heavy lifting related to capacity planning,
  provisioning, monitoring, and patching.
3)Simplify your architecture with Message Filtering
  Amazon SNS helps you simplify your pub/sub messaging architecture by offloading the message filtering logic from your subscriber systems, and message routing logic from your publisher systems.
4)Keep messages private and secure
  Amazon SNS topic owners can set topic policies that restrict who can publish and subscribe to a topic. 
  Amazon SNS also ensures that data is encrypted in transit and at rest, 
  and provides VPC endpoints for message privacy.
